This Explore Card is a responsive UI component built using HTML and CSS, designed to showcase a product or dish with a clean and modern layout. The card features a grid-based design that adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes. On smaller screens, the card displays in a single-column layout with the image on top and the text below. On medium and larger screens, it transitions to a two-column layout with the image on the left and the content on the right. The card incorporates the Poppins font for a contemporary look, and uses a color palette with a soft gray heading color (#6c8091) and a vibrant gold for the paragraph text (#d0b200). Padding of 16px is applied around the content for proper spacing, and the grid layout is enhanced with a 16px gap between elements. The design is fully responsive, ensuring the card maintains its aesthetic and functionality across all devices.
